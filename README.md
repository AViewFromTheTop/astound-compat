# Astound Compat
This mod adds or modifies things that cannot be changed using datapacks or CraftTweaker for the modpack [Astound](https://github.com/lumiscosity/astound).
It probably won't be of much use outside of Astound considering its limited scope.

# Features
- Custom [Abstract](https://github.com/Frogipher/Abstract) trims and panels
- Custom [Wilder Wild](https://github.com/FrozenBlock/WilderWild) hollowed logs
- Custom ladders and bookshelves matching the ones from [Jineric Mod](https://github.com/Jiingy/Jineric-Mod)
- Custom [Promenade](https://github.com/DawnTeamMC/Promenade) leaf piles
